## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries.

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:

This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries.

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {

                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },

                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"

                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2

            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,

            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]

## The format of the fix
This is the description of the json format in which you should write your fixes (respect this format when calling the commands write_fix and try_fixes):
The provided format is a list of dictionaries, each representing a set of edits to a specific file. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.
    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.
        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.
    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.
    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:
        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.
        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.
Here is an example:
[
    # changes in file 1
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",
        "insertions": [
            {
                "line_number": 175,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\n",
                    "    // ... more new lines ...\n"
                ]
            },
            {
                "line_number": 180,
                "new_lines": [
                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\n"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "deletions": [179, 183],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 179,
                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 185,
                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\n"
            }
        ]
    },
    # changes in file 2
    {
        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",
        "insertions": [],
        "deletions": [],
        "modifications": [
            {
                "line_number": 203,
                "modified_line": "    days = 0\n"
            },
            {
                "line_number": 307,
                "modified_line": "    super()\n"
            }
        ]
    }
]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:
1: Think of mutating comparison operators in a condition, e.g, < to >= and == to !=... Consider all possibilities and combinations even == to >, != to <= ...for example.
    Original: if x < 10:
    Fix: if x >= 10:
- 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible) or with close variable names
    Original: result = add(x, y)
    Fix: result = add(5, 8)
    
    Original: mult = y + 1
    Fix:  add = z + 1
- 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)
    Original: start_elements_valid = True
    Fix: end_elements_valid = True
- 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding 'and' / 'or' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of 'and'/ 'or' parts)
    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):
    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):
    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):
- 5: if your patch consists only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard the patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead
    Orginal: '// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug'
    Fix: pos = findWrapperPosition(text, width, start);
- 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code, you should consider adding more lines at given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.
    Example:
     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {
        min = Math.min(minimum, v);
+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here
        }
    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {
+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here
        maximum = Math.max(max, u);
        }
- 7: pay attention to the comments and doc string above the buggy code, specifically if any important comments exist above or next to buggy lines.
    Example:
    // - verify the header checksum
    This comment indicates that a verification of the header checksum, which can be done by calling a method dedicated for that.
- 8: the usual fix of some null pointer exceptions is to add a condition on the variable(s) that can be null.
    Original: entity.create()
    Fix: if (entity != null){
        entity.create()
    }
- 9: Do not modify a file by replacing lines with a comment. If you want to delete a line you can add its number to the list of lines to delete.
Always suggest code and not comments only.
Example of forbidden fix because it only writes a comment and not actual code:
    {
        modifications: [{"line_number": 105, "modified_line": "// need to improve this code"}]
    }
- 10: Pay attention the type of variables. The code before and after the buggy lines might give hints of what the type of a variable should be.
Example:
    int x = 20;
    double y = x * x; // x should have been declared as double in the previous line
- 11: You also should be careful with types in java, especially numerical types.
For example int * int might produce a double which means it should be stored in double variable
Another example is int + int would also produce double.

- 12: If the buggy line is a method signature, consider changing the signature of the method. Also, consider checking similar methods or neighboring methods by searching the code base.
Examples:
    change private to public or protected and vice-versa
    change the type of an argument
    add or remove an argument

Your fix should target all the following lines by at least one edit type (modification, insertion, or deletion):
111 from file: org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java

Task for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). For every mutant generate a full fix dictionary. Put the 30 mutants in a main list.To generate the list of your mutations, fillout the following template multiple time with different variants:
[{"file_name": "org/jfree/chart/util/ShapeList.java", "target_lines": [["111", "        return super.equals(obj);"]], "insertions": [here put the list of insertion dictionaries. DO NOT REPEAT ALREADY EXISTING LINES!: {"line_numbe":..., "new_lines":[...]}, ...], "deletions": [here put the lines number to delete...], "modifications": [here put the list of modification dictionaries {"line_number":..., "modified_line":...}, ...]}]
