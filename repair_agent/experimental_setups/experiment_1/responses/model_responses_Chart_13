The issue is at line 455 in BorderArrangement.java where a Range is created. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the Range creation to ensure the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound.",

The subtraction operation 'constraint.getWidth() - w[2]' is causing the upper bound to be negative, leading to the IllegalArgumentException. To fix this, we need to ensure that the upper bound is greater than or equal to the lower bound when creating the Range.",
